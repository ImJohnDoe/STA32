# STA32

Welcome to the repository for discussion code snippets from STA 32 W 15 at UC Davis. 

This code is intentionally left (mostly) undocumented because it should serve merely as a skeleton for discussion sections where Jeremy will explain and demonstrate the scripts. Thus, the documentation and other miscellaneous 'filling in the blanks' is left up to the student. 

Thanks for visiting!
